## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4b7db41`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/4b7db41fb1c247ed766ff10284e9cdabd4ab0a25) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Implement new text layout based on DOM and text ranges

### Patch Changes

- [`f3602b0`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/f3602b04970c8cb88ea41e87e63ee4709b086d61) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - improve line cap detection for CJK fonts

- [`28f58c6`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/28f58c67f9eae8e0123a915d0efea03eaccd5e27) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - fixed a bug with generator that caused it to not load all characters in a font, especially CJK

- [`047e5e3`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/047e5e31d3ffabbecf25dd36b5f56d298731c630) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add `duration` and `easing` options to uncontrolled time mode.

  - `duration` stretches or compresses one iteration to take exactly N seconds, derived from the natural timeline inside the engine. Mutually exclusive with `speed` / `catchUp` at the type level (discriminated union); when both are set at runtime, `duration` takes precedence.
  - `easing: (t: number) => number` maps linear progress (0–1) to displayed progress (0–1). Applied at read-time, so `currentTime`, `onTimeChange`, and the `--tegaki-time` / `--tegaki-progress` CSS custom properties all reflect the eased value. Completion is evaluated against linear progress so overshoot/undershoot curves (e.g. `easeOutBack`) don't trip completion early or late.
  - The web component adapter accepts a `duration` attribute; `easing` is available via the `time` JS property only (it's function-valued).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [`7198553`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/719855392734a8f1b6056db9f0718ac7a8213527) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add controlled progress mode to allow users to specify the exact progress of the animation that is a value between 0 and 1.

### Patch Changes

- [`b326f00`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/b326f00d52b97ef19e0214cb4595bd31cd501cf4) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add delay and loop gap for uncontrolled animations

- [`1449890`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/144989014c0d9cdbf80fafbb77af646b96065832) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add docs and example for using Tegaki with Remotion. The example is a simple composition that renders a single text prop, but the same principles apply to more complex compositions and dynamic props.

- [`1449890`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/144989014c0d9cdbf80fafbb77af646b96065832) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Fix rendering when zoom level was not 100%.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/pull/12) [`e43197f`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/e43197f5719368bed5280aa106c8fcb7afe05b4e) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add CDN-friendly font bundles and `createBundle` helper

  - Built font bundles now use `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` instead of bundler-specific import attributes, making them work natively in browsers and on CDN services like esm.sh and jsDelivr
  - Glyph data JSON is inlined in the built output so no import attributes are needed at runtime
  - Added `createBundle()` to `tegaki/core` and `tegaki/wc` for manually assembling a font bundle from fetched glyph data and a font URL

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b0dabe4`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/b0dabe4ede42564ca2fadf68a3db23a94c55d163) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add Web Components adapter (`tegaki/wc`) with `<tegaki-renderer>` custom element and docs page.

### Patch Changes

- [`4068d1c`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/4068d1c74413e302b73375897aa9377c215a087a) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Fix user-provided inline styles being overridden by engine root styles in Astro, Svelte, and Solid adapters.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`be540e1`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/be540e13d47804b2068ee111f0297ef4809d6550) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Remove extra wrapper div from TegakiRenderer DOM output. The engine now uses the adapter's container element directly as its root (`data-tegaki="root"`), eliminating a redundant nested div. This fixes CSS-controlled animations where styles applied to the `<TegakiRenderer>` component (like `animation-timeline`) weren't reaching the engine's root element. `renderElements` now returns `{ rootProps, content }` instead of a single element tree.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`9288227`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/9288227945a7623158990744809dc7d711536a7a) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Tegaki is framework agnostic now

### Minor Changes

- [`dc581bf`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/dc581bf2e68324ba810c01aea3b7d5c646462a42) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Fix font bundle types and make sure they are assignable to the expected type.

### Minor Changes

- [`2236325`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/2236325c7119b6de47be3f479b3e01b2cae4b907) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Rework font loading and improve defaults

  - **Breaking**: Remove `registerFontFace()` from `TegakiBundle`. Font registration is now handled internally by `TegakiRenderer` via the FontFace API.
  - Add `fontFaceCSS` property to `TegakiBundle` for SSR/stylesheet-based font loading.
  - Export `ensureFontFace()` utility for manually preloading a bundle's font.
  - Fix font layout being calculated with wrong font metrics when switching fonts or when the font isn't loaded yet.
  - Enable `pressureWidth` effect by default.
  - Handle non-JS environments (SSR) more gracefully.
